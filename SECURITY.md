# Security policy

I welcome security reports for my projects. The efforts and contributions from individuals who wish to help improve the security of my software are very much appreciated.

## Reporting a security issue

Please make initial security reports privately.

If possible please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting system. The process is explained in the [creating a repository security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory) section of GitHub's secure coding documentation. If that tool is not available to you then you may contact me via email. You can use the email address that associated with my git commits in the repository.

If you are unsure if an issue has security implications then reach out to me via the security reporting process anyway. I'll work with you to verify and classify the problem.

## Responsible disclosure

A standard 90 day disclosure window is generally acceptable to me. I will try to reply promptly to any communications. But please remember that I am just some random dev putting code online, and life sometimes alters my priorities for a while. If your initial contact doesn't receive a reply within a week then please try again, or try via an alternate communication method.
