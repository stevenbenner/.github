# Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. And contributing isn't just writing code. Everything from submitting patches to whinging about the software is contributing - so long as it is done through the correct processes.

## Providing feedback

Please submit general feedback, critiques, and feature requests via GitHub discussions.

I welcome all types of relevant feedback on my projects. In fact I find it incredibly helpful to read about other people's experiences of using my projects. Everything from _"it works perfectly"_ to _"it was an unusable mess"_ can be helpful feedback. Reading your experience reports tells me about the state of the project, if anyone is actually using it, and how it is used outside of my own use. Which greatly helps informing my decisions about what to change and how much effort to devote to it.

## Reporting problems

Bug reports should be submitted via GitHub issues.

A good bug report includes:

* The environment that you're running
* Exact steps needed to reproduce the problem
* Any relevant code, logs, screenshots, or videos

The job of a bug reporter is to assist the developer in understanding and reproducing the problem. If I cannot replicate the problem that you're seeing then I will be unable to fix it. So be as descriptive and specific as possible when you provide reproduction steps.

I generally try to respond promptly to new issue notifications. But please be patient with me. Sometimes I have other priorities and don't have the time or energy to dig in to a long problem diagnosis and debugging process.

## Submitting patches

Patches are very appreciated. All patches should be proposed as pull requests on GitHub. The process is explained in the [creating a pull request][createprdoc] section of GitHubs [pull requests][pulldocs] documentation.

I prefer small pull requests with small change sets that are easy to review and reason about. If you want to propose a big change to the project then, if possible, break it up into multiple (perferably atomic) patches that I can separately verify and merge.

Please make sure to test your changes before submitting a pull request.
